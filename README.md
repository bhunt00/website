# Profile

My name is Billy and I am a motivated hardworking individual with a passion for IT. I've completed a Level 3 Infrastructure Technician apprenticeship and I am on the verge of completing my Level 4 Network Engineer apprenticeship. My desire is to progress through the IT industry.

I am an experienced and skilful Windows System Administrator with excellent organisation and problem-solving skills. I am dedicated to stick to standardised procedures and to follow the industryâ€™s best practises within the IT world.

I am always willing to research and develop my technical skills outside of work within my own virtual homelab through the use of Hyper-V.
